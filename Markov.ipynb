    "# Using MarkovChain to generate sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chains can “generate” a word B from a word A, if and only if B followed A at least once during training. \n",
    "Moreover, B is picked from a list of candidates which is sorted by occurrence, and thus, by probability. \n",
    "A dash of randomness is then added to spice things up a little bit and to (try to) prevent loops, but this is mostly a solution to the problem of not having a large enough data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the first implementation detail about Markov chains is learning. A corpus of text should enter our black box and a horizontal tree, where each word is a branch, should come out. Leaves are represented by all the words related to a particular branch, and their “size” depends on their relative frequency.\n",
